Packers QB Brett Favre is approaching several plateaus: his 13th 3,000-yard season would tie Dan Marino for most all time; should he lead the league in TD passes, he would break the record of four he shares with Johnny Unitas, Len Dawson, and Steve Young; Favre is tied with Marino (10) for most consecutive seasons with 20 TD passes.

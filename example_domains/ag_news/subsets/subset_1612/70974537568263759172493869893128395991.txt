ATHENS -- Through five games, the US women are outscoring opponents by 29 points a game. They've been dominant to the point of ennui. They crush their opponents on the glass, hand out twice as many assists per game, and, generally, have it their way, every game. They lead the Olympics in nine statistical categories.

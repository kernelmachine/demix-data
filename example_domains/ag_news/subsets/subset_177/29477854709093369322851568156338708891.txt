Thoroughbred racing will return to Rockingham Park for the first time since September 2002 when the Salem, N.H., track hosts three grass races Sunday. Rock will hold an 11-race card, with the first eight races harness contests. As far as the Rock publicity department can determine, it will be the first time standardbreds and thoroughbreds have shared a racing program.

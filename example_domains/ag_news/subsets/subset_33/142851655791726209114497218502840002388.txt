AP - Paula Radcliffe decided there was only one way to get over the heartbreak of twin failures at the Athens Olympics: race again. She will do that Nov. 7 in the New York City Marathon, less than three months after pulling out of the event in the Summer Games. Radcliffe made the announcement Tuesday, 12 days before the race.

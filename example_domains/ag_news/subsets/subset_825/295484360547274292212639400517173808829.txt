What happened in Brussels today is unique in the   Western world: never has a so-called democratic regime outlawed the country's   largest political party.  The party outlawed is for Flemish self-determination.  When Belgium's largest political party (despite being a minority, which even the largest parties usually are in parliamentary politics) cannot even seek self-determination via democratic means, aren't international organizations obligated to ask what self-determination really means in a liberal democracy?

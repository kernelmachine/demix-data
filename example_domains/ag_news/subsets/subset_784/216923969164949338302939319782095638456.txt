Canada's Prime Minister Paul Martin, while attending the APEC Summit in Santiago, Chile, tried to garner support among world leaders for his idea of instantiating a new world forum, a so-called L-20 group of leaders, consisting of the G-8 countries and the leaders of about 12 other emerging economic powers like India, China, Brazil and South Korea.  As The Toronto Star reported, the animated Prime Minister Martin literally had to be yanked away by his own handlers after describing in urgent tones the need for United Nations reform and for a new forum of world leaders that he wants to create. He bemoaned Sudanese being slaughtered while the UN dithers, he interrupted several questions from reporters to elaborate further, and Saturday he waved off an aide who tried cutting off a press conference.

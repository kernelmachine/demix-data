BAGHDAD -- Iraq's electoral commission yesterday set Jan. 30 for elections to choose a National Assembly, a vote that could deliver power to Iraq's Shi'ite Muslim majority after decades of disenfranchisement. The balloting, however, remains imperiled by calls for a Sunni Muslim boycott and a persistent insurgency that has roiled Sunni regions.

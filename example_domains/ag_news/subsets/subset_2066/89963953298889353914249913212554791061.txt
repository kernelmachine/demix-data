BusinessWeek Online - For more than a year, PeopleSoft Inc.  CEO Craig Conway has battled to prevent Oracle Corp.'s  Larry Ellison from grabbing his company in a hostile takeover. Now, Conway's spirited quest has absorbed a potentially fatal blow: On Sept. 9, U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn R. Walker ruled that the Justice Dept. had no grounds to block the acquisition. While the European Community could still stop it, the legal case for halting this shotgun wedding is looking weaker by the day.

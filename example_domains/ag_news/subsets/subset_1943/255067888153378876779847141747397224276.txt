Norfolk County Treasurer Joseph Connolly makes \$89,000 a year. His wife, Elaine, has a hotel job, and they own a home in Weymouth. Connolly also has two part-time jobs, one of them a seat on the Weymouth City Council, another teaching at Curry College. By most standards this family would be considered well off.

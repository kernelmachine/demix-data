Paneer is a kind of soft cheese used in Indian cuisine.  It's a bit like ricotta.  It takes minutes to make, and you can experiment with it.  This recipe is neither particularly original, nor particularly authentic.  But, you get stuff that looks and tastes like the paneer you get in Indian restaurants, so it must be pretty close.  It doesn't use rennet, so it's vegetarian-safe.  It isn't vegan-safe.

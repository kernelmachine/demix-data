AP - The Tampa Bay Buccaneers found a way to beat the Kansas City Chiefs. They simply outscored them. Michael Pittman scored one of his three touchdowns on a team-record 78-yard run and Tampa Bay held off the Chiefs 34-31 Sunday, giving the Bucs consecutive victories for just the second time since they won the Super Bowl two years ago.

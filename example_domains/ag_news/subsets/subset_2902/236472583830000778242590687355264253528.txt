Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, on the first leg of a hastily-arranged tour of countries devastated by the tsunami, said Monday he would focus on assessing the progress of the relief effort and trying to inspire aid workers and survivors. Powell also said he did not anticipate announcing an increase in the \$350 million in reconstruction assistance pledged by the United States.

\\I spent today packing up everything I own.  I'm moving into a new apartment in\two weeks and the movers need to have everything in boxes.\\About 60 of the weight from everything I own is due to books.  Probably\equivalent to the weight of one dead tree.\\Its just a data!  Theres no reason to have it in meatspace format!  I can't\compress it!  I can't search it!  I can't create a backup copy!  Books are evil!\\Thats it.  I'm done.  No more.  From here on out I'm only going to own at a\maximum of 20 books (hopefully less).  \\I'm either going to use Safari  or sell the book once I'm finished reading\them.  If there's anything I need I'll just paste it into my personal wiki and\use permalinks. ...\\

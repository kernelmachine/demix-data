Forbes.com - The stock market in 2004 has been, at best, treading water. Yet presidential election years are supposed to see equities rise. This one will be no exception. Stocks often go up in rapid bursts. As people grasp that President Bush will indeed be reelected, the market will experience a sharp rally. Expect the S amp;P 500 to end the year well above 1250, up at least 12 from year-end 2003.

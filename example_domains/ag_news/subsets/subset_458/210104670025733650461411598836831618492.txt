 #147;The iMac G5 is completely user serviceable, #148; writes Leander Kahney for Wired News.  #147;With its simplified, modular interior, the machine was designed to make it easy for consumers to perform their own repairs. If something goes wrong, Apple dispatches a spare part, and the owner performs the do-it-yourself repair, from swapping out a faulty hard drive to installing a new flat screen. The new iMac is perhaps the most user-serviceable machine on the market. #148; Nov 01

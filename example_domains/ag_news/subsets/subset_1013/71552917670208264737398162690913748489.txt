Steganography is the science of hiding one message inside another message - hiding in plain sight, so to speak.  Think of steganography as the soft-spoken yet elegant sister of cryptography. Where cryptography scrambles a message to prevent unauthorized people from reading it, steganography opts instead to hide the message in such a way that it is not obvious that there is anything there to see.  Read on for a description of steganography, with examples.

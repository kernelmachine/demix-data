\\Right now if I want to show you a resource local to my desktop I'd have to copy\it to an HTTP server and then provide you with the updated URL.\\While most geeks can do this easily enough its pretty hard for most users.  Its\also very confusing.\\I guess IM is moving in this directly.  If you want to give them a file just\drag it into your IM session.\\URLs might be overkill because you'd never want to put a local URL into an HTML\document or blog post.\\Then again it would be cool to have my own burtonator: URI scheme!\\

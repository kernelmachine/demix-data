NEW YORK -- In the city that loves to hate Pedro Martinez, the sellout crowd at Yankee Stadium suffered only one minor disappointment yesterday. It came after Martinez walked John Olerud in the sixth inning. The free pass followed Jorge Posada's home run, a shot that landed just a few feet inside the left-field foul pole.

 JAKARTA (Reuters) - Former general Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono  took office as Indonesia's first directly elected leader on  Wednesday after sweeping to power by vowing faster job growth,  a war on corruption and tough punishment for terrorists. A  solemn-looking Yudhoyono was sworn in at parliament in front of  the very legislators many expect will challenge the big popular  mandate he won in Indonesia's historic democratic presidential  ballot last month.

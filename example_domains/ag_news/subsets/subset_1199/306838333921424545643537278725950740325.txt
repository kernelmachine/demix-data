 LONDON (Reuters) - The yen held close to the previous  session's four-week high against the dollar on Thursday while  the dollar held steady on the euro as investors awaited U.S.  labor and manufacturing data due later.  The Japanese currency  rose to a high of 109.28 per dollar late on Wednesday, as cross  currents in the market, mainly from a steep sterling fall,  forced yen sellers to buy the Japanese currency back, pushing  it higher against the dollar.

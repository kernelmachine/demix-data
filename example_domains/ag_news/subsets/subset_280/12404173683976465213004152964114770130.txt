  Sean Harrigan was ousted from his post as president of the \$177 billion California Public Employees' Retirement System. In a 3 to 2 vote in San Francisco, the California state Personnel Board pulled Harrigan from Calpers, where he had served for five years. Elected as Calpers board president in February 2003, Harrigan is a longtime union official and an advocate for corporate governance reform. He persuaded institutional investors to withhold votes for Walt Disney's Michael D. Eisner as board chairman, and he led a drive to withhold votes for Safeway chief executive Steven A. Burd while the union was on strike against the company. Ron Alvarado will succeed Harrigan beginning Jan. 1, a board spokeswoman said.

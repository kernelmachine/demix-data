  Back in the days of stone knives and bearskins applications were  things that were written in cretinous languages like COBOL that  ran on wierd 71 bit architectures and used messed up file formats like  JCL and VSAM files or whatever.  What's a 'Data Division'?  Some whiny  80s band from Manchester?      Of course today we are so much  smarter.  If you look at the evolution, from ML, to branched languages  to structured programming to OOP, and from 3270 applications, to PC  apps to client server to web apps, you can clearly see how the  applications programmer transformed himself from knuckle dragging  simian to homo sapiens. That's the stereotype, right?    We have a name for all that old stuff, a pejorative name:  'legacy'.1   I'm here to tell you that the web application is the new  legacy.

Ex-employees of company called Voters Outreach of America AKA America Votes claim that voter registrations in Las Vegas have been trashed.     The article recommends that people make sure they're registered to vote. If you're a victim of the fraudulent voter registration that is rife in the prelude to this election you should insist on your right to make a provisional (or affidavit) vote at the polls as guaranteed by the Help America Vote Act of 2002.    Voters Outreach of America has reportedly moved on to Oregon presumably to do the same thing.

InfoWorld - Cray taps Linux for more affordable supercomputing\ Trying to expand outside its traditional technical markets, Cray on Monday unveiled its first Linux-based supercomputer. The new Cray XD1 series runs Suse Linux on AMD #8217;s Opteron chip. The 64-bit system is organized as six two-way SMPs that can deliver 58 gigaflops per chassis. The system can handle as many as six 3.5-inch serial ATA drives and has a memory bandwidth of 12.8GB per SMP. It also features four PCI-X bus slots and a dual port Gigabit Ethernet PCI-X card for as many as eight Gigabit Ethernet ports per chassis. Pricing starts at  #36;50,000 for a 12-processor chassis and goes to  #36;2 million for a 288-processor configuration with two racks of 12 chassis each.\XD1, Cray

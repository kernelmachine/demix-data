AP - The Dallas Cowboys spent a week comparing Steelers rookie quarterback Ben Roethlisberger to a young Dan Marino. How about some Terry Bradshaw to go with it? Roethlisberger completed 21 of 25 passes and two touchdowns, completing 11 straight throws on the Steelers' last two scoring drives Sunday, leading Pittsburgh to a 24-20 comeback win over the Cowboys.

TOKYO - NEC Electronics Inc. restarted production at its Yamagata, Japan, factory on Monday evening after a series of strong earthquakes over the weekend halted manufacturing. However, two factories near the epicenter of the quakes remain off-line and the companies that operate them have no estimate for when they will be back online.

Florida coach Ron Zook was fired yesterday after two-plus years and a stack of embarrassments on and off the field, satisfying a growing groundswell for his ouster that began the day he replaced Steve Spurrier . Zook will finish out the season while athletic director Jeremy Foley and school president Bernie Machen search for another coach.

The Motley Fool - Well, it looks like General Motors (NYSE: GM - News) has done it once again. The auto industry's leader in offering consumer incentives has come up with a brand new pitch to try to lure buyers into its showrooms. If you buy and finance a 2005 GM vehicle by the end of November, the next GM vehicle you purchase within five years can be financed at today's low rates -- as long as the vehicle is purchased before the initial loan expires.

AP - What used to be routine felt like a novelty to Tiger Woods. After four straight birdies on his way to a 5-under 65 at East Lake, the former No. 1 player in the world was introduced Saturday as one of the 54-hole leaders in the Tour Championship. Woods raised his cap in mock celebration, and for good reason. It's been more than a year since he has been in this position.

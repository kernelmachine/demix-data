Waltham's boys' soccer team is still unbeaten, and Richard Awa is still red-hot. On the strength of two goals by Awa, visiting Waltham earned a 3-3 tie with No. 2 Everett yesterday. Everett also remained unbeaten, while Waltham, coming off a subpar season, remained the surprise story of this campaign.

AP - After finishing 13-3 last season, the Kansas City Chiefs are thinking Super Bowl. The Denver Broncos always think Super Bowl, even though they've made the playoffs just twice in the five years since John Elway retired and haven't won a postseason game. So while it may be premature to think of their meeting in Denver on Sunday night as an AFC championship game preview, it could be critical in the AFC West, where the Chiefs and Broncos figure to battle for the title.

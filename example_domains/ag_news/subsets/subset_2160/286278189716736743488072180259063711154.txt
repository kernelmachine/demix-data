MacCentral - At a special music event on Tuesday, Apple took the wraps off the iPod Photo, a color iPod available in 40GB or 60GB storage capacities. The device will automatically synchronize music and photos on both Macs and PCs. Apple is shipping the new iPod Photo today for U #36;499 or  #36;599 depending on capacity. Also introduced today is a special iPod U2, a black-clad 20GB model coming in mid-November for  #36;349. It comes with a red Click Wheel and a custom engraving of U2 band member signatures. More details about both new iPods will be posted shortly.

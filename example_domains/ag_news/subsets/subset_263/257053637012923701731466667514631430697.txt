AP - The Cubs had only Monday available to play their makeup doubleheader against Florida, and as it turned out, the weather was great. But to Dusty Baker's dismay, David Weathers was pretty good, too. The journeyman right-hander, making his first start in six years, limited Chicago to two hits and one run in five innings, and the Marlins won the second game 5-2 to earn a split.

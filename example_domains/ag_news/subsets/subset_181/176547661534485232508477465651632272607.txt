 AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - After an absence of a decade, Philips  Electronics is making personal computers again, the company  said on Thursday.  The Netherlands-based electronics  conglomerate, which abandoned the PC business in the early  1990s after suffering big losses, quietly introduced six models  together with British retailer Dixons earlier this week.

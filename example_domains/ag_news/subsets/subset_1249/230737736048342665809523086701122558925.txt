The Economist is currently reporting the results of a survey of professional economists. When asked the majority seemed to feel that the economy was safer in Kerry's hands than in Bush's. The Bush tax cuts seem to have gone down particularly poorly with this group.     On the more positive side for Bush, a significant number of the economists say they don't think the problems of the US economy are entirely his fault.

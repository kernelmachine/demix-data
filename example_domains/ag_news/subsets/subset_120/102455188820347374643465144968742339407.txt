AP - Three straight late-season stumbles have taken the luster off Virginia Tech. Now the Hokies are looking to get it back, and there's no better way to do that than to knock off No. 1 Southern California. The Hokies and Trojans open the season Saturday night in the Black Coaches Association Classic at FedEx Field, home of the Washington Redskins. The game begins at 7:45 p.m.

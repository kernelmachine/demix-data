AP - Ichiro Suzuki got one hit and plenty of help in knocking Oakland out of first place. Suzuki's fifth-inning single gave him 255 hits, two shy of George Sisler's 84-year-old major league record, and the Seattle Mariners sent the Athletics into second place in the AL West for the first time since Aug. 5 with a 4-2 victory Wednesday night.

Outlook:  No other team in the nation has a running back duo like Minnesota's Marion Barber III and Laurence Maroney, who have combined for 274.4 rushing yards per game -- and distribute it quite evenly. Michigan freshman QB Chad Henne went 17 for 21 for 316 yards and three touchdowns last week against Indiana and hasn't thrown an interception in the past two games. Plus, the Wolverines' aggressive defense leads the nation with 19 takeaways.

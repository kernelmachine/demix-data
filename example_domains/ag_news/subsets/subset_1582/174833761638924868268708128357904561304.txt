SAN FRANCISCO - Logitech Inc. was set Wednesday to introduce a new mouse that uses a laser beam to track the movements of the device. The mouse, which Logitech claims will be the first such laser-tracking device, provides end users with better click-and-point capabilities than traditional LED- (light-emitting diode) based optical mice, according to company officials.

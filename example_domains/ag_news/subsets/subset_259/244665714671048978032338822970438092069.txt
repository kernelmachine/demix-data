Comparing photo slideshow computer applications, Thomas E. Weber writes for the Wall Street Journal,  #147;Those using an Apple computer won #146;t need to agonize over which slideshow program to choose. Apple #146;s excellent iLife package (\$49; included with new Macs) is all they #146;ll need. Users can construct slideshows in the package #146;s easy-to-use iDVD program or move slideshows from iPhoto into iDVD for burning onto a disc. For more effects, the iMovie video-editing software can add panning and zooming motion. #148; Aug 17

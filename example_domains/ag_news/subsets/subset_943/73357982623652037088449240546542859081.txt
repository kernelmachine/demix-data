AP - On his souvenir bobblehead night, Zydrunas Ilgauskas shook Gund Arena and the Phoenix Suns. Cleveland's 7-foot-3 center drained three long jumpers, including a tying 3-pointer at the end of regulation, and the Cavaliers rallied for a 114-109 overtime win against Phoenix on Wednesday night, the Suns' first loss this season.

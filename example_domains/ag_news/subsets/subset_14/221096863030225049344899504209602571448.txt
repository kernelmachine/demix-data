AP - Johnny Damon and the Boston Red Sox are putting pressure on the New York Yankees and pulling away from everybody else. Kevin Millar homered and drove in four runs, Damon had four of Boston's 16 hits, and the streaking Red Sox beat the Anaheim Angels 12-7 Wednesday night at Fenway Park for their eighth consecutive victory and 14th in 15 games.

USATODAY.com - IBM and the rest of the tech industry might have a better year than most onlookers expected. IBM's third-quarter earnings rose 15 from a year earlier, to  #36;1.17 a share, excluding a one-time  #36;320 million charge to settle a lawsuit over its pension plan. That beat analysts' average estimate by 3 cents a share.

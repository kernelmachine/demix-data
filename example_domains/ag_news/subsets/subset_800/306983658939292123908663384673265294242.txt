NEW YORK - While Oracle Corp. awaits a judge's decision on whether it can continue in its quest to acquire PeopleSoft Inc., the company faced a setback in an unrelated case. An appeals court on Wednesday ruled that a three-year-old shareholder lawsuit charging Oracle and several of its top executives with misleading investors about Oracle's performance may proceed, overturning a lower court's dismissal.

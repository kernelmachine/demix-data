 LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar paused on Tuesday after a  broad-based rally in the previous session as investors waited  to see if forthcoming data would reinforce the Federal  Reserve's optimism in the U.S. recovery.  Upbeat comments on  the U.S. economy from central bankers Robert McTeer and Ben  Bernanke on Monday bolstered the greenback across the board,  lifting it a two-week high against the euro and a one-week high  against the yen in early trade.

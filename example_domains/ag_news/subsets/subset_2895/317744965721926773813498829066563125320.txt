PHUKET, Thailand -- Day after day, the bodies keep arriving at Wat Lam Kaen. The Buddhist temple in the Khao Lak beach section of this popular resort is one of several temples in the area that have been turned into makeshift morgues, where the calming aroma of incense has been overcome by the sulfurous smell of decay.

 LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar rose slightly in the first  trading session of 2005 on Monday, gaining more than a cent  from recent record lows against the euro as investor selling  paused ahead of U.S. economic data this week. However, analysts  said persistent imbalances in the U.S. economy will likely  continue to weigh on the dollar in 2005 after pushing the euro  up about 8 percent to record highs last year.

AP - Palmer and Woods. How's that for a leaderboard? Too bad it's tour rookie Ryan Palmer  #151; not Arnold  #151; sharing the lead with Tiger Woods after one round in the Deutsche Bank Championship. The two shot 6-under 65s Friday on the TPC of Boston to take a one-stroke lead over Mark O'Meara and two others.

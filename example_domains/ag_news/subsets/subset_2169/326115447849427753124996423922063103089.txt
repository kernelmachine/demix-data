AP - After a temper tantrum that led to an eight-game suspension and a course in anger management, Jose Guillen needed a change of scenery. He'll find it in the nation's capital. The Anahiem Angels traded Guillen to the Washington-bound Expos  #151; the soon-to-be Nationals  #151; on Friday for outfielder Juan Rivera and prospect Maicer Izturis.

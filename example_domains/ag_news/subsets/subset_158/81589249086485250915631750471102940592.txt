OAKLAND, Calif. -- Jacksonville's first winning season in five years wasn't enough to make the playoffs. Byron Leftwich looked out of synch, but the Jaguars still managed to beat the Raiders, 13-6, yesterday. Though the Jaguars (9-7) were in postseason contention when the game started, they were knocked out when Denver beat Indianapolis.

Forbes.com - Walk into the Urban Outfitters in Manhattan's West Village and you're tempted to sit down on one of the white vinyl benches near the entrance. From there you can admire the antique armoire with mirrored front, along with champagne flutes, martini shakers and small metallic Christmas trees. There are plenty of casual clothes for young women and men (target age: 18-30), as well as accessories, furniture, books, gifts, makeup and soaps. If you want shoes, you have to go to the back of the store near the registers, where the display is archly arranged to resemble a woman's dressing room.

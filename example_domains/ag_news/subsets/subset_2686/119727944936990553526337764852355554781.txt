AP - Brian Ching got another big goal, and the United States received the gift of jewelry. Ching scored just five minutes in on the Americans' first shot, and El Salvador was forced to play a man short after a defender was ejected midway through the first half for wearing a gold chain. Landon Donovan went on to score a second-half goal, and the United States won 2-0 Saturday to move into good position to advance to the regional finals of qualifying for the 2006 World Cup.

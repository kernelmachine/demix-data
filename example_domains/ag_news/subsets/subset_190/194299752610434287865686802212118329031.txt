It's winter again, and that means chili time. There's not much better than coming in out of the cold to a good hot (hot!) bowl of chili, preferably served over macaroni with grated cheddar cheese on top. Now, everyone makes chili differently, so of course no one is actually going to follow my recipe exactly, but that's all right. If you want inferior chili, that's your right as an American. Foreigners, you may be out of luck, but then, do you have any business making chili, anyway? This applies to Californians and New Englanders, too.

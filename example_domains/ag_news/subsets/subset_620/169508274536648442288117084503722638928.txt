\\We have a few domains hosted on Network Solutions.  For one reason or another we\were in a hurry and just used NetSol as our registrar.  BIG mistake!\\They are one *pathetic* organization!\\They are a DNS company.  That's what they DO!  Their DNS admin only allows 10\IPs. Of course they don't tell you this when you signup.  You only find out that\the UI doesn't allow for additional IPs until try to add them.\\To add insult to injury when you try to move AWAY from NetSol by changing your\primary and secondary they drop your IP configuration immediately.  You're just\out of luck if there are clients which have cached your primary and secondary\DNS servers.\

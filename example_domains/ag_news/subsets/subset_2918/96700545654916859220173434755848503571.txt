MORGAN HILL, Calif. -- In the lobby of Alien Technology, giant statues of Robbie the Robot and Klaatu from  quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still quot; stand guard over the reception area. Hanging on one doorway leading to the inner sanctum is a sign that reads:  quot;Area 52. Restricted Area. Secret Research Facility. quot;

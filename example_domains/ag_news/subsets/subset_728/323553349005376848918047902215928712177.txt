    1 Southern California at Stanford  &lt;em&gt;7 p.m., TBS &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not that long ago -- 1999 to 2001 -- Stanford won three straight in this series, but times have changed. All the preseason hype was for USC quarterback Matt Leinart, but he may not even be the best player on his team. Tailback Reggie Bush can, and will, line up just about anywhere. Something must give: USC is averaging 38 points per game; Stanford is allowing just 6.5.

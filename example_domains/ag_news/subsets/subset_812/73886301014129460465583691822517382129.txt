Forbes.com - China is embarking on its first full-fledged United Nations peacekeeping mission. A group of 125 Chinese police officers will soon arrive in Haiti. The Carib-bean-bound officers of the People's Armed Police were rigorously chosen. During their three-month training, they were given lessons in French (but not Creole, the language most commonly used in Haiti). More importantly, they were brought up to speed on international norms of peacekeeping, with instructions on how to maintain order, diplomatic protocols and human rights.

U.S. jets pounded suspected Shiite militant positions in the Baghdad slum of Sadr City on Monday, killing at least five people and wounding 40. Elsewhere, insurgents detonated a car bomb and fired rockets, killing at least four National Guardsmen, in separate attacks targeting Iraq's beleaguered security forces.

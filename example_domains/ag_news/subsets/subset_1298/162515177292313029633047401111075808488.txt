MacCentral - Microsoft's Macintosh Business Unit on Tuesday issued a patch for Virtual PC 7 that fixes a problem that occurred when running the software on Power Mac G5 computers with more than 2GB of RAM installed. Previously, Virtual PC 7 would not run on those computers, causing a fatal error that crashed the application. Microsoft also noted that Virtual PC 7.0.1 also offers stability improvements, although it wasn't more specific than that -- some users have reported problems with using USB devices and other issues.

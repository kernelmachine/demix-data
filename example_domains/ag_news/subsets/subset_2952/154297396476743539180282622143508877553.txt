Just back from three weeks in China, Ill spare you the boring slides except for two observations. First, China presents amazing contrasts. You can bounce over mountain roads and still enjoy four bars of reception on your cell phone. (In general, Chinas cell coverage makes that of the United States seem Third World.) Second, China has a great future in IT.

\\The PeerFear blog is built on top of a custom CMS that I wrote about two years\ago.  It doesn't support Atom, trackbacks, and some people report problems when\posting from IE.\\I installed Moveable Type but to be honest I am less than thrilled.  It doesn't\support category RSS feeds and I can't associate images for categories like I'm\currently doing.\\So it appears I'm stuck... \\Anyone have any feedback?  Maybe I should install one of the OSS blogging tools.\\

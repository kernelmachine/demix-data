AP - The future of Paul Hamm's gold medal has nothing to do with tumbles and flips, and everything to do with the judgment of three arbitrators. The Court of Arbitration for Sport held an 11 1/2-hour hearing Monday to determine whether Hamm should again be declared the winner of the Olympic gymnastics all-around competition, or the victory should go to Yang Tae-young of South Korea.

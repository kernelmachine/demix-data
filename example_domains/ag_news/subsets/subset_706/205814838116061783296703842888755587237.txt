Do you hate the government?  Do you want to smash the corporate slave state?  Are you an     anarchist, punk, eco-freak with a bad haircut and attitude?      Is your idea of a fun hobby sitting in your basement practicing your bomb-making skills?      Do you listen to Rage Against the Machine all the time and have     your walls lined with posters of Che     Guevara?  Do you actually want to do something to bring about the Revolution instead of getting stoned and rambling about the     Zapatistas?  Well here's something easy and powerful you can do     to help bring the walls down:    Vote for Bush.

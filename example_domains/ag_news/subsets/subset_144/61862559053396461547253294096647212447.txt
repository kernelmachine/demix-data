Foxboro junior Tim Cheney opened last night's Hockomock League heavyweight matchup against North Attleboro at his 2-yard line with a bobble and a stumble. He was fleet-footed the rest of the way, regaining control to take the opening kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown and lead Foxboro to a 32-7 romp of the Red Rocketeers.

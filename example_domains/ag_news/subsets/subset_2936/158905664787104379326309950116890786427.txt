AP - Walking Barry Bonds intentionally to load the bases in the 10th inning turned out to be the wrong move for Florida  #151; because Rudy Seanez then walked pinch-hitter A.J. Pierzynski on four pitches. Pierzynski's walk forced home the tiebreaking run in the San Francisco Giants' 6-5 win over the Marlins on Wednesday night. It was just his 14th walk in 397 plate appearances.

I smashed up my room the other day. I pulled open my cupboard, throwing clean clothes all over my carpet, cracking clothes hangers over my knee and tossing them aside. I threw my ornaments off the shelf, spraying fragments of pottery, glass and wood everywhere. I upended the dirty washing from my basket. I smashed up furniture, throwing splinters among the mess.

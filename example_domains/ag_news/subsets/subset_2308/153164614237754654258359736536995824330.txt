 CANBERRA (Reuters) - An Australian terror suspect was  offered the services of a prostitute by the U.S. military if he  agreed to spy on other detainees held at the Guantanamo Bay  base in Cuba, according to court documents. In an affidavit  unsealed by a U.S. District Court and seen by Reuters on  Friday, David Hicks, a 29-year-old convert to Islam, said he  was also beaten while blindfolded and handcuffed, threatened  with weapons and had his head rammed into asphalt.

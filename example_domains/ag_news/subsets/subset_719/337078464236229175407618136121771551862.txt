 PARIS (Reuters) - The United States said on Tuesday it may  soon take legal action in a trade row over government help for  Airbus and Boeing, particularly as the European aircraft maker  was seeking support for a new project. Washington and Brussels  have so far resisted launching legal action at the World Trade  Organization (WTO) in their battle over allegations of illegal  subsidies to the aviation rivals, but that option may now be  just weeks away.

Delonte West was in uniform last night at the FleetCenter, after the Celtics activated the rookie point guard for the first time this season and placed forward Justin Reed (left hip pointer) back on the injured list. Although not fully recovered from the fractured right thumb he suffered the day before the season opener, West felt good enough to play.

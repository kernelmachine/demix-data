 MILAN (Reuters) - Turin's Olympic Committee needs to raise  another 65 million euros from sponsors to meet targets for the  2006 Winter Games, its chief said on Monday after reports of a  huge budget gap had sparked a national political row. Turin's  mayor ordered an audit of Olympic spending after organizers  said they had a 180 million-euro (\$227 million) hole in their  books due to sponsorship shortfalls and lower sales forecasts.

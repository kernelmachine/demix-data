Forbes.com - At 42, Nicholas Gerber is a little too young to retire, but he is already thinking about how to sell the business he started nine years ago. It's the management company for Ameristock Mutual Fund, which has attracted  #36;1.8 billion with a stellar record: up 14 a year since 1995, five points more than the market average. His style is to buy out-of-favor blue chips like Sara Lee, Merck and Bank of America, and hold. Turnover is tiny at 5 a year.

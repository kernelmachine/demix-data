 #147;It has been a good year for Apple, #148; writes Wilson Rothman in naming the iMac G5 TIME Gadget of the Week.  #147;Since the beginning of 2004, I #146;ve discussed GarageBand, AirPort Express and the latest iPod. If you go back 12 months, you can probably even throw in iTunes Music Store, the original G5 and the official release of iChat AV. This isn #146;t favoritism, I #146;m just impressed. Rather than spend money on its silly  #145;Switch #146; ad campaign, the company has spent it inventing actual reasons for people to switch from Windows to Mac, not least of all personal style. The iMac G5 is super suave, but it #146;s also a pretty good deal. #148; Sep 22

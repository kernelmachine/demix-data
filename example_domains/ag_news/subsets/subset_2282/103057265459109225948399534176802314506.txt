MacCentral - Joined on stage by legendary rockers Bono and The Edge from U2, Apple Computer Inc. CEO Steve Jobs on Tuesday expanded Apple's hugely popular iPod line-up with two new models. During the event, held in San Jose, Calif., Jobs said that Apple didn't feel video was the right way to take the iPod, opting instead to add a color screen and allow users to sync photos with their device. Analysts agree with Jobs' strategy and feel the pricing the devices is right.

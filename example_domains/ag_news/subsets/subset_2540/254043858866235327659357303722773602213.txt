AP - David Carr put together a huge comeback of his own after Brett Favre showed him how to do it last week. Carr threw for 201 yards and two touchdowns and Domanick Davis rushed for a season-high 129 yards and a score to help the Houston Texans rally from an 18-point deficit in a 31-21 win over the Tennessee Titans on Sunday.

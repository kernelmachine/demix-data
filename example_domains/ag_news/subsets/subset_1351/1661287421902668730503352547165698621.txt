Overall Israel will withdraw from the Gaza Strip and parts of the northern West Bank in 2005, without coordination with the Palestinians. Israel contends the current Palestinian leadership is not a partner for peace talks. Twenty-one settlements in Gaza and four in the West Bank will be removed by September 2005, followed by a pullout of Israeli troops.

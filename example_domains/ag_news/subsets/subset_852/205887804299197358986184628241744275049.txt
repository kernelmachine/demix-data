 TOKYO (Reuters) - The dollar edged up on Tuesday as weaker  oil prices helped it to recover losses made on data showing  overseas demand for U.S. assets may have stalled. U.S. light  crude traded around \$53.21, easing from a fresh record high of  \$55.33 hit in New York and helping to keep the dollar away from  near eight-month lows hit overnight.

The Jacksonville Jaguars now have lost both starting defensive ends for the season. The Jags placed Lionel Barnes on injured reserve yesterday with a shoulder injury. Barnes hurt his shoulder Sept. 19 against Denver. He missed one game but returned to the starting lineup two weeks ago against Indianapolis. He did not play last week at San Diego.

NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CLASS REUNION was a flop when it was released. It didn't stay long in theaters in my big city. Why? Because it's BAD!!!!!Not bad in a good way but bad in a really painfully unfunny way. The entire cast of actors were mostly unknowns then and have remained unknowns after this turkey.The idea is actually great (a parody of slasher flicks) but the execution is sorely lacking in every aspect. Just avoid this "comedy". Your time is more precious than spending a nanosecond watching this embarrassing misfire.

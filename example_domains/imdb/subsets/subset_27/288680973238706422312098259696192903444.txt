How is it possible that a movie this bad can be made. Bad acting. Bad script. Just an embarrassment all around. This is just one bad cliché after another.This movie actually has some big name stars in it. Unfortunately they're singers and not actors.This movie made hardly any money for a good reason. The appeal of black cowboy movies just isn't there. It's a shame they didn't have a good story to tell. This movie actually has some big name stars in it.

The film was written 10 years back and a different director was planning it with SRK and Aamir in lead rolesThe film finally was made now with Vipul Shah directing it And Ajay and Salman starring together after a decade HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM(1999)The movie however falls short due to it's 90's handling and worst it's loopholesThe film tries to pack in too many commercial ingredients and we also hav the love triangleEverything is predictable and filmy and too clich√©dThere are loopholes like how Ajay runs away from London Airport and makes a place for himself with no one? even the way he starts his band is not convincing The second half gets better with the twist in the tale of Ajay destroying Salman but sadly the climax falls short and the film ends on a bad noteDirection by Vipul Shah is ordinary to below average Music is the worst point, most songs are mediocreAmongst actors Ajay gives his best shot though he isn't convincing as a Rock singer yet he does superb as the negative role Salman however irritates with his punjabi and talking nonsense he only impresses when he gets drugged and thereon Asin is nothing great just a show piece Ranvijay should stick to MTV Om Puri is okay

I watch bad movies.This movie is not good enough to be a bad movie. Not an ounce of humor, not an ounce of talent throughout.I am LAZY.Usually, I see a bad movie and curse. This was so bad, I actually made a review to try and save others from the completely boring mess I fell victim to.I am smashing my copy of this movie.It's too lame even to use clear a room. So boring. Watch 'Bloodsucking Freaks' or 'Shock, shock, shock' for absolute crap that has some merit as entertainment. This sludge looks awful, is awful, and whoever made it should feel awful.

Not as bad a film as i thought it would be.It has a good cast.Nice to see Roger Moore back on screen as well as the use of other British actors.Would like to see more of Olivia D`Abo in future projects.Maybe starring opposite her cousin the sexy Maryam D`Abo.Also a good use of unseen locations such as Luxembourg.Hopefully we will see more UK-European co-productions like this.

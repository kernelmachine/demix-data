Maybe the greatest film ever about jazz.It IS jazz.The opening shot continues to haunt my reverie.Lester, of course, is wonderful and out of this world.Jo Jones is always a delight (see The Sound of Jazz as well).If you can, find the music; it's available on CD.All lovers of jazz and film noir should study this tremendous jewel.What shadows and light - what music - what a hat!

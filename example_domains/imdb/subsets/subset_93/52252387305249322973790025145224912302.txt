I was about thirteen when this movie came out on television. It is far superior in action than most movies since. Martin Sheen is excellent, and though Nick Nolte has a small part, he too provides excellent support. Vic Morrow as the villain is superb.When Sheen "tests the water" in his '34 Ford (COOL) along the mountainous highway it is spectacular!The ending is grand.I'm disappointed in the low vote this received. I figure the younger generations have more interest in much of the junk that is coming out these days.Good taste eludes the masses!

The only reason i am bothering to comment on this movie is to save you all 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money.I bought it ex-rental for Â£3.00, it looked interesting, so i took a chance.Within minutes of turning it on i realised i'd made a mistake. The entire cast should be stored away until winter and then thrown on the nearest log fire, where they could meet more of their kind.As for the Devin Hamilton (Writer and Director), he should just be shot, sadly this should have been done before he made this rubbish.Avoid this film, If you see it in the shops run away.1/10

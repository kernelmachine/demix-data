How many more of those fake "slice of life" movies need to be made? Hopefully not too many.Raising Victor Vargas is a very self-conscious attempt by the director Peter Solett at garnering the attention of Hollywood. Nothing wrong with that in general. What is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every clich√© in the book of supposedly "edgy" Hollywood independent production.It's supposed to be "real" so left shake the camera "documentary style", except no documentarian would shake the camera on purpose...It's "edgy" so let's not waste any time lighting the film.It's "hip", so let's have the children use swear words like Al Pacino in Scarface...And so on, and so forth. All that you are left with is a very self-conscious attempt at impressing Hollywood that won't impress anyone outside of the "rarefied" indie crowd that seems to still heap acclaim on every bad film.

Unusual? Yes!Unusual setting for an American wartime movie, New Zealand.Unusual subject matter, four sisters and their relationships with American soldiers, from one bearing the illegitimate child of the dead son of a Senator, to another living with seven Marines (one at a time) before being murdered by her returning POW New Zealander husband.Unusual to see Paul Newman deliver such a poor performance so soon after his unforgettable role as Rocky Graziano in the brilliant "Somebody Up There Loves Me".Unusual for two fine "Stars" Joan Fontaine and Jean Simmons, to leave so little of themselves on a movie.Unusual that I could be bothered to write a review of such a poor film, give it a miss!

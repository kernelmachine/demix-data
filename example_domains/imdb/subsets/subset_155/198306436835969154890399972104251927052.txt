I notice the DVD version seems to have missing scenes or lines between the posting of the FRF and the launch. They are to prove they can win the right to sit in the FRF other than the green team.Another scene is like during their failure at the simulation, Kevin gets Joaquin to clam down.I think the VHS edition other than the ABC one might have all the missing stuff.Otherwise I like to know which DVD release has the missing stuff.The DVD I have watched feels edited for television.

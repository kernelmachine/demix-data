Quite possibly the worst movie that I have ever seen. When has Hollywood ever made a successful movie that attacked Republicans? Why don't they learn. The Dixie chicks haven't. These Lefties live in their own elite bubble interacting among themselves; oblivious to the fact that most of America is much further right than they are.The best Hollywood productions are not partisan and are rarely political at all.Dan Akroyd's imitation of Cheney was bad.I would have thought Cussack could have landed better movies.It wasn't funny.

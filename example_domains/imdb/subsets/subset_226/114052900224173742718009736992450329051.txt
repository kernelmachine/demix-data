i am a big fan of karishma Kapoor and Govinda. I watched this film after i had seen Fiza, which was absolutley brilliant.There are films that are bad, and there are films that are cr*p. but this film just takes the biscuit.We were so annoyed that we were conned out of paying our money expecting a decent film.avoid at all cost, dont even rent it.1/10

Basic slasher movie premise, 3 young ladies wreck their car and end up staying with a creepy family. YAWN.Watching 36 minutes of a premonition of OJ's car chase with a white sedan instead of a bronco. YAWN.Old lady with hot and cold dementia controlling her daughter... YAWN23 minutes of watching the actors eat - YAWN Trying to identify what the heck they are eating ... OK there might be a drinking game here ... nope - YAWN Complimentary shower scenes ... OK got my interest for a couple of seconds.Completely random and uninspired killings ... YAWN The ending ... dude! that psycho is deranged - why couldn't the rest of the movie be like the last 5 minutes... unfortunately that is it - My advice - fast forward to the last five minutes and watch that and then put something good in the player - for me I am going back to sleep.

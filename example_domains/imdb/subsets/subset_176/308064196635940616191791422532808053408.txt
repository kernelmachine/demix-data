If I have to give this movie a score on a linear scale, then I have to give it a low score 3/10.But it was entertaining, and there are several good things to say about the movie.The psychiatrist candidate James Bishop is assigned to St. Andrews Hospital for his resident, and is exited and eager to "change the world".From the beginning of the movie you know that the hospital is hiding an evil truth, but James thinks he can make a difference and doesn't recognise this evil. The story builds fairly well, you know all the time that there is a truth in what the patients are telling about some resident evil, and wonder when and how James will discover this. Also when the break comes, James is in a way hunted by the evil, and you feel some suspense until "the fight" is over.Add an innocent beautiful girlfriend that arrives at the worst possible time and other standard horror elements, and you get the picture.The character buildup is actually fairly good, you are introduced to most of the people that gets killed, some of them you "get to know".The film sets an unpleasant scene, this is also done fairly well. There are mysteries that are unveiled - in an acceptable way.The main character, James is very believable - the story about an eager student starting to work is good in this setting.What kills this movie is: * Stupid special effects - a modern version of "Plan 9 from outer space"-type bad (the evil monster looks like a red scarecrow) * Some bad acting (or probably very few takes when filming) - The main characters sometimes acts badly, and somtimes good. * The sound is at times very cheap.I kept thinking "I could make a movie like this with my home video camera" throughout the film.

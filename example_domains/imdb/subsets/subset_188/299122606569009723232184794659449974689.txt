To be brutally honest... I LOVED watching Severed. That's why Igave it a 1/10 stars because of its starkly unimaginativestory/filming/acting/everything. This film was a RIOT to watch. Ifyou enjoy watching bad films in order to poke fun at them, you willreally get a kick out of Severed.The story really doesn't matter, it involves some guy who's baldand has a sword and goes around beheading random people. But he has a supernatural twist... nobody ever sees him do it. Even when, in one very memorable scene, he walks into ajampacked night club and whacks off some girl's noodle andnobody sees it. Severed doesn't merely look like it was filmed on video- it WASfilmed on someone's home camcorder. The filmmakers hadknowledge of lighting (very thin knowledge) and compositionactually holds together in some scenes. But mostly you can't hearthe actors... you can't understand what they're doing, and you laughwhen the next vicitm gets his pumpkin detatched from his body.Go and rent this movie. Support films like this- they are a hoot anda hollar!

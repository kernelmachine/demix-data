Remember the name Kevin Lime - and please, please never lethim direct again. Timing, pacing, editing: all hopelessly wrong.Three or four decent professionals (next time, guys, walk off theset) can do nothing to save this film from amateurs like AliceEvans, and the kind of production standards you'd expect fromteen-produced children's shows on british TV.Greatest mystery: the music. A score so inept, inappropriate andill-matched to the tone of the film that one seriously wonders if it isa case of sabotage. Add an acoustic that booms apparentlyunengineered from a single mike, and a director who onlyintermittently remembers to add auditory action offscreen, and wehave what must be on of the greatest ratio of money to result ofrecent years.

Words fail me.And that isn't common.Done properly this could have been great, funny spoof B-movie sci-fi, but sadly, it was not to be. Rarely in the field of drama have so many competent actors struggled so vainly with such a dogs-breakfast of a script. I can only endorse the previous reviewer's comments - go clean the bathroom. In fact do ANYTHING except watch this film.Positives: Lucy Beeman's nose. Negatives: Everything else.Most apposite line: "This isn't going anywhere".If only every plastic surgeon could meet with such a fate.

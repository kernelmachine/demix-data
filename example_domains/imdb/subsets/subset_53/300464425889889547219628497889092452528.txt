the more i think about it, there was nothing redeeming about thismovie. i saw it 9 months ago, so my memory might have made itworse than it was, but i do know it was at least as bad as a 4 out of10. after seeing the movie, i met the director. he seemed so cluelessas to what he was doing or what he had done, and as far as icould tell, he didn't care for the film either. even he agreed that hedidn't really know what he was doing, and he was forced to docertain things because it was filmed digitally. i felt that the movie was trying to hard to fit in to the formula that itbuilt for itself: "9 people all have to be connected in some way. howcan we get from point 'A' to point 'B'" so in order get from theprostitute we see in the start and back to her at the end they 10minutes on each character's relationship to another person. itmakes one feel choked by the 2 demensional, badly drawncharacters.I just remembered the one redeeming part of the movie... SteveBouchemi there is one scene where he is amazing. that's it. as isay... 4 out of 10.

Dil was a memorable movie that bring to the celluloid a great director like Indra Kumar. The movie followed with Beta, Ishq, Raja & Masti all of whom were superb.But then every successful director gives a few horrible movies alongwith some hits too. Pyare Mohan is one such movie.Though the comedies are told nicely but then they fail the viewer to laugh. Comparing with the kind of comedy movies being made today this is a dumb.If you really want to watch a movie and laugh, please don't watch this. Because the pathetic comedy will make you cry only.In short, the movie is worth a miss.

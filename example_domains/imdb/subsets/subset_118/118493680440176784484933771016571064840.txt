Its like if you took the general themes of The Usual Suspects and Fightclub, take away all their style and class and mixed them together with a lot of pretentious new wave "i'm intellectual so my movie must be hard to make sense of" film maker rubbish, mashed in a few extra styles for good measure, chopped off the ending, there you have Revolver.Yes, I did think about it for a little bit after watching, and yes it did kind of make sense, however that doesn't stop it being garbage.Waste of money. Waste of time.Up there as the worst Movie I have ever seen, with not even a bad movie novelty value to redeem it a little.

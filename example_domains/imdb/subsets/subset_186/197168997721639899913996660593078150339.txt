DD films were damn corny, damn stupid and had a plot which seemed wafer thin but those days they was a plot at leastThis film isn't just a comedy but a mix of melodrama, romance everythingEvery drama scene is blown out of proportionThe comedy is funny but corny too Yet the film keeps you entertained, those days Govinda films were loud, crass yet they had some funny moments people enjoyedDavid Dhawan does a okay job Music is okayGovinda acts well in comedy and drama Karisma is decent in parts and annoys in parts Kader is as usual Gulshan, Prem Chopra are typecast Shakti is hilarious

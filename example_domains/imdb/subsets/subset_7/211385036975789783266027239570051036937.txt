Thanks to this film, I now can answer the question, "What is the worst movie you have ever seen?"I can't even think of a close second, and I've seen some really bad movies.Absolutely nothing works in this film. Name a single element of any horror film and this movie fails. Honestly, I've seen better on YouTube. Here's some typical dialogue:"Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve, is that you?" "Steve, I'm not kidding" "Steve, this isn't funny!" "Steve, are you there?" "Steve?" "Steve?" "Steve?""ARggh!!!! Ahhhhhh!!!! Nooooooo!"

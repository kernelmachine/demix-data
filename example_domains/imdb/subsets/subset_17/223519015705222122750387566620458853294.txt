This movie was so very badly written. The characters had no depth. They should have never made a movie of this. My 11 yr old son could write a better screenplay then Hyung-rae Shim.The only actor that didn't suck was the zoo guard. He was the only funny and believable one of the lot.I love movies and try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but this one was up there on my lame list at number 2. Number 1 being Demonicus.For those of you who actually thought this was a good movie, you are in serious need of brain surgery.Most of the creatures in the movie weren't even dragons...so why did they call D-war?

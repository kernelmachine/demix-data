Quite unimpressive. The 'twists' are all pretty predictable, if you've seen any movies within the last ten years, and the few somewhat interesting parts (wherein someone utilizes context clues to make a decision) are few and lack much punch, since the 'secret' has already been shown before these clues are explained.(spoilers, sorta)The acting is decent enough. The story simply isn't very interesting. The whole 'still awake' premise becomes nullified by the astral projection stuff(not kidding). The surgery scene is initially tense, a bit discomforting, but then becomes utterly banal.Not horrible, but not memorable. Terrence Howard's least interesting role to date, so far as I've seen. Kind of boring, overall.

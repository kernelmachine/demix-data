(spoilers)I was blown away by this movie. I've been renting on movielink for a bit, and decided to check this movie out. Alot of boxing movies seem to overblow the blood. In this movie, it shows it at the amature level. Though I do wish that perhaps more attention would have been brought to perhaps her improving her grades. The movie points out the problems some families face with gender.I was a bit concerned with the ending. But the ending wasn't a disappointment either.I think it was pretty clear by the title that she'd win. What was unexpected was that the two of them got back together sort of at the end.Loved the score for some of the scenes. Highly recommended.10/10Quality: 9/10Entertainment: 10/10Replayable: 10/10

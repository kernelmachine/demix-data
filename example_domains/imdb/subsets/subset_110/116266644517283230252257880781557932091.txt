and laugh out loud funny in many scenes.The movie's basic plot is well chronicled, a story of opposites trying to find a way to survive each other in close proximity.This is unquestionably Lemmon and Matheau's best film as co-stars, and the interaction between the sloppy Oscar and the OCD Felix are classic.The scene where Oscar lines up a double date, leaves the room briefly, and comes back to find Felix and the two girls all crying is pricelessly funny.For any fan of intelligent comedies, The Odd Couple is a "go out of your way to see it" film.

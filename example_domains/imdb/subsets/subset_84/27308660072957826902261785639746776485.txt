The power rangers is definitely the worst television show and completely ridiculous plastic toy line in the history of the United States.There is absolutely nothing even remotely entertaining about this completely awful television show.This is simply the worst show ever made, with awful actors, dressing up in multi colored spandex outfits that look completely ridiculous.The owners of this show should be ashamed of themselves, since there is no redeeming value to this nonsense.Kids of today should try watching better shows like the Toy Story movies instead of this garbage.

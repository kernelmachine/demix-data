I was around 7 when I saw this movie first. It wasn't so special then,but a few years later I saw it again and that time it made fun,a lot:)I think the best parts of the film are: Yeti's body language and the 'special effects ' also.If you wanna watch this movie ,don't wait for a Hollywood made blockbuster,even this film was made from approx. 1000 dollars :) I've a copy of it.Movie and video version as well(But I don't think it had been ever shown in cinemas)Watch it,enjoy it!!!Yeti for ever!!!

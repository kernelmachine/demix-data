I've read one comment which labeled this film "trash" and "a wasteof time." I think this person got their political undies tugged a bittoo much.I just rented the new Criterion DVD's of both Yellow and Blue.These films--although hardly great--have at least become ofhistorical interest as to the so-called "radical studentpolitical-social movement"of the late '60s.I hadn't seen either picture and from their notorious reputation, Iwas expecting some real porn (there isn't any.) There is frontalnudity (including the still verboten frontal male nudity (automaticNC-17--the Orwellian-X) in the U.S. But I wasn't expecting the filmsin-your-face democratic socialist message. Though it tends to the simplistic , I thought it occassionally madeits points well. Both films occassionally had me laughing out loudand the director's commentary made it clear there was plenty ofparody in the film. Especially the supposedly "pornographic" sexscenes. The first such scene is very realistic. The lead couple isclumsy, inept, funny and endearing in their first copulation scene.The second--which caused the most complaints--has fakedcunnilingus and fellatio. And the last is the end of an angry fight,that is believable.The extras include an informative introduction to the film, aninterview with the original American distributor and his attorney,excerpts from trial testimony in the U.S. and a "diary" commentaryby the director on some scenes.This is the film that "blue noses" wouldn't let alone and led to thepivotal "prurient interest with no social redeeming value" standardthat, thankfully, still stands.Those with an interest in the quirks of history will find this a mustsee.

My wife and I are semi amused by Howie Mandel's show.. I also like Shatner - even when he's at his most pathetic..But this is absolutely the worst show on television.Please cancel this show. It sucks a**.The only positive thing I can say is that the girls are hotter on this show and seem to wear less clothing than Deal or no Deal...The questions are a mixture of way too easy and incredibly obscure. And watching Shatner or the contestant say "Show me the money" makes me want to vomit..This one will not last.

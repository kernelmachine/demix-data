What can I say? I ignored the reviews and went to see it myself. Damn the reviews were so right. What a waste of money considering it's budget.Good thing, I went to see Kill Bill after this one.To see a really scary movie, would be Crossroads!Bottom line-- I like "Girl in Gold Boots" better than this crap.

I think Micheal Ironsides acting career must be over, if he has to star in this sort of low budge crap. Surely he could do better than waste his time in this rubbish.This movie could be far better, if it had a good budget, but it shows repeatedly through-out the movie. There is one scene at a outpost, which looks like, its outside the front of a railway station, and i bet it was.There is one scene which made give this movie a 3, and it shows the space craft landing and taking off over a lake, surrounded by forests. This was well done, but the rest of the movie, forget it.There is another scene, which looks like a engineering plant, which i bet it, and does not look like a space outpost as the character say it is.This movie is stupid, has a serious low budget, makes no sense and God Help Micheal Ironsides.

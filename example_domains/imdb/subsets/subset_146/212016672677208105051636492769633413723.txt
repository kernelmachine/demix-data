Wow, I love and respect pretty much anything that David Lynch has done. However, this movie is akin to a first filmmaker's attempt at making a pseudo art video. To give you a couple of examples: 1. David Lynch is typically a visual filmmaker, however, this had little visual artistic content (blank walls, "up shots" with ceiling in the background) 2. David Lynch typically takes great pride in audio, however, in this you could even hear the video camera's hum. In fact, it is very hard to swallow the idea that he had anything to do with this movie. unless......this is a joke, on David's part, to force fans search his website (for hours) only to find this drivel. I hope so, because at least that idea is funny.

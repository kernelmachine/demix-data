I love killer Insects movies they are great fun to watch, I had to watch this movie as it was one of my Favourite horror books by Shaun Hutson.I have met him and I wish I did listen to him as this movie was terrible like he Said it was,after he said that I was still dying to see how bad it was.The plot: People are dying mysteriously and gruesomely, and nobody has a clue what the cause is.Only health worker Mike Brady has a possible solution, but his theory of killer slugs is laughed at by the authorities.Only when the body count begins to rise and a slug expert from England begins snooping around does it begin to look like Mike had the right idea after all.This movie as the most overacting you ever see a movie! Slugs in this movie are fast (Then normal) and it looks like they fast forwarding the scenes! This movie is nothing like the book at all, the book was ten times scarier, ten times gory and had a lot more story to it!I didn't like this movie at all! As I am huge fan of Slugs the book and second book called Breeding ground! Both of books are Great Read the book then watch the movie, you may like more then I did Give this 2 out 10
